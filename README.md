# OpenAim

OpenAim is a small aim trainer made from scratch in C++, using OpenGL as the rendering backend.

## Building on Linux

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KleberPF/OpenAim.git
cd OpenAim
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To run the game

```
./OpenAim
```

## Building on Windows

I managed to compile it using VS, but some changes had to be made, mainly to the file paths used inside the code. I plan to make it easier to compile on Windows, but for now I won't provide any instructions. It should be easy enough with some tweaks.
